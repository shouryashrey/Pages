A dedicated application for bibliophiles from where they can browse through hundreds of books and magzines, can purchase them via the shopping interface or via Buy Now links for individual items.

On the back end, you can manage inventory, process online orders, and run sales reports. Additionally, all Bookstore transactions are automatically fed into your General Ledger.
